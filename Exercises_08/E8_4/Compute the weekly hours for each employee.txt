Compute the weekly hours for each employee

Suppose the weekly hours for all employees are stored in 
a two-dimensional array. Each row records an employeeâ€™s 
seven-day work hours with seven columns. For example, 
the following array stores the work hours for eight 
employees. Write a program that displays employees and 
their total hours in increasing order of the total hours.

Employee 0   2  4  3  4  5  8  8
Employee 1   7  3  4  3  3  4  4
Employee 2   3  3  4  3  3  2  2
Employee 3   9  3  4  7  3  4  1
Employee 4   3  5  4  3  6  3  8
Employee 5   3  4  4  6  3  4  4
Employee 6   3  7  4  8  3  8  4
Employee 7   6  3  5  9  2  7  9
