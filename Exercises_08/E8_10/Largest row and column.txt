Write a program that randomly fills in 0s and 1s into
a 5-by-5 matrix, prints the matrix, and finds the 
first row and column with the most 1s. 
Here is a sample run of the program:

===================================
01101
01011
10010
11111
00101
The largest row index: 3
The largest column index: 4
