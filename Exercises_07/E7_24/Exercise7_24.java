/****************************************************************
 * 7.24 (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) 
 * Coupon collector is a classic statistics problem with many 
 * practical applications. The problem is to repeatedly pick 
 * objects from a set of objects and find out how many picks 
 * are needed for all the objects to be picked at least once. 
 * A variation of the problem is to pick cards from a shuffled 
 * deck of 52 cards repeatedly, and find out how many picks are 
 * needed before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card 
 * is placed back in the deck
